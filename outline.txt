Website Structure & Layout
----------------------------

Block - Standalone entity that is meaningful on its own
ex: header, container, menu, checkbox, input, button

Elements - Parts of a block and have no standalone meaning. They are semantically tied to its block.
ex: menu item, list item, checkbox caption, header title

Modifiers - Flags on blocks or elements. Use them to change appearance or behavior.
ex: disabled, highlighted, checked, fixed, size big, color yellow
